Every Mail.app method which is to be swizzled, has to be prefixed
with MA (MailApp).

There's a folder in Resources which is called old. This folder
is used to diff the a modified xib with the latest xib.
It's used for localizeXIB. 
DON'T EVER DELETE THIS FOLDER!

* Reverse Engineering *

- Sometimes it's not to easy to find out what happens to an
  object you created. In that case you can over release it,
  using autorelease or release. This way, the object will be
  ending up an NSZombie, which can later be tracked using Instruments
  allocation tool. (VERY HELPFUL)

- clearCachedDecrypted is called everytime the message is unlodaed.
  we should better cache it.

- Mail internally seems to use firstChildPart to determine the charset of the message.

_getSomeCharsetFromPartTree -> exists only internally

* Committing *

- Always use git -p <filename>. This let's you decide for each file
  what lines should be added to a commit.
- Use this to create commits which only fix one problem at a time.

* Other *

- Mail.app comes with a lot of general class enhancements. It's best to look
  them through to find helpful ones.
